# YouTube-video-download
Python code to extract a video from YouTube.

This code allows you to download a Youtube video from a specific url.
You can choose if you want the video with or without sound, the resolution of the video, and to which path you want to save the file.

The user will have input prompts that allow to interact with the code.

For now, this is the only feature. I've also thought about making it possible to extract only the audio but still not done yet.

Thanks,
Mauri ;)
